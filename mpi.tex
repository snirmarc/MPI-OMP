\section{MPI}
\subsection{Current Standard}
	The MPI 3.1 standard defines how MPI interacts with threads (Chapter 12.4 
	of the
	MPI 3.1 Report): MPI processes can be multithreaded; in the 
	\texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_FUNNELED} mode all MPI calls must be made by the same 
	"master" thread, but other compute threads can run concurrently. In the 
	\texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE} mode, multiple threads can invoke MPI calls 
	concurrently; a blocking MPI call blocks the calling thread but does not 
	block other threads; and a 
	non-blocking call that is started by one thread can be completed by another 
	thread. 
	
	Note that the MPI standard does not define what an MPI "process" or  
	a "thread" is. Most MPI implementations equate an MPI process with a POSIX 
	process and an MPI thread with a POSIX thread. Some MPI implementations 
	equate an MPI process with a POSIX thread. In such implementations, an MPI 
	"process" is single-threaded.	
	
	\subsection{Performance Issues}
	We list below several MPI performance issues that affects MPI when 
	processes have a large thread count.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
			The use of \texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE} may result in a 
			significant overhead per MPI communication -- when there is a large 
			number of simultaneous communications \cite{thakur2009test, 
			goodell2010minimizing,farmer2016mpi}. In 
			extreme (and 
			unrealistic) cases, the overhead per MPI call may increase by two 
			orders of magnitude \cite{dang2017eliminating}. The main reason is 
			that current MPI 
			implementations use coarse-grain locks to ensure mutual exclusion 
			for concurrent MPI calls -- as these calls need to perform atomic 
			updates to shared data structures. The problem can be palliated by 
			the use of finer grain locks, but this tends to increase the 
			overheads in the low-contention case, as an MPI call will now 
			involve multiple lock-unlock operations. Finer grain concurrency 
			code is also more complex and bug-prone, and is avoided even when 
			concurrency control should be relatively simple, as for one-sided 
			communication
			\cite{dosanjh2016rma}.
			
			\item 
			The execution of receive calls slows down when there is a large 
			number of pending receives 
			\cite{brightwellseastarqueue,ferreira2017characterizing}. The 
			reason is that the 
			matching of sends to receives requires the traversal of a linked 
			list of unmatched sends (when the receive is posted) or a linked 
			list of unmatched receives (when the sent message arrives). The 
			linked list implementation is hard to avoid, due to the requirement 
			that communication preserves order and the support of wild-card 
			receives. (Order preservation requires an ordered search; wild-card 
			receives prevent the hashing of messages into distinct 
			bucket.) Partial solutions exist \cite{m5}, but the problem worsens 
			as the number of threads increases.
			\item 
			If many threads are blocked, waiting for the completion of 
			communication calls, then the overhead for waking up each
			increases: In a typical implementation, a blocked thread is woken 
			up by the thread scheduler and checks whether the request(s) it is 
			waiting on is (are) satisfied; if not, it yields control and 
			another 
			thread is woken up. If there are many threads, this may result in a 
			high count of spurious wakeups \cite{dang2017advanced}
			\item 
			Progress of MPI communications require the asynchronous execution 
			of MPI software and of driver software below MPI. This includes 
			polling for incoming messages and, for long messages, the 
			initiation of an rDMA transfer once Send and Receive have been 
			matched (rendezvous protocol). These asynchronous activities are 
			part of the \emph{progress engine} logic. The progress engine can 
			execute in one of two ways:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item
				As a side effect of  MPI calls: Whenever MPI is invoked, in 
				addition to handling the specific call, the progress engine is 
				invoked.
				\item 
				Using a dedicated \emph{progress thread} that continuously 
				executes the progress engine.
						\end{enumerate}
			The first alternative has the disadvantage that progress may not 
			occur if no MPI call is invoked. With the rendezvous protocol, when 
			a Send is issued a "request-to-send" message is sent to the 
			receiver; the actual transfer of data is started when an ack 
			message comes back from the receiver. But, with no progress thread, 
			the actual transfer of data might not occur until the sender 
			executes 
			another MPI call, resulting in no overlap between communication and 
			computation \cite{Denis2016mpioverlap}. Users have managed this 
			issue by interlacing the 
			execution with spurious "noop" MPI calls, in order to jump-start 
			the progress engine. The resulting code is less desirable, from a 
			Software Engineering perspective (no separation of concerns and 
			less portability).
			
			The second alternative has the disadvantage that a thread is 
			dedicated to communication and is not available for computation. 
			This becomes less of an issue with high core counts and 
			multithreaded cores: In many cases the use of a progress thread 
			improves overall performance \cite{vaidyanathan2015improving}. Also 
			techniques, such as 
			those described in 
			\cite{hoefler2008message,denis2014pioman},can dynamically vary the 
			resource 
			consumption of progress threads.
			
			The use of a progress thread is likely to be important for the 
			performance of non-blocking collective operations: A process that 
			does not kick-start the progress engine may slow down many other 
			processes. It is important for the performance of one-sided 
			communications as those often require the execution of software on 
			the passive process. Both MPICH and Open MPI and  can be 
			initialized to run with a progress thread.
		\end{enumerate}
	

There is ongoing work, both in MPICH and OpenMP, to palliate the impact of some 
of these issues
these issues \cite{balaji2008toward,mpicon2,mpi-thread,dang2017advanced}. Also, 
vendors may enhance support to 
MPI in 
future 
generations of NICs, thus reducing the impact of these issues. 
		
	\subsection{Possible MPI 4 extensions}
	The MPI forum is discussing several proposals that could be relevant to 
	this document \cite{MPI4}. Among them:
	
	\paragraph{Interoperability with task-based runtimes} (\#75) This would add 
	an \texttt{MPI\_TASK\_MULTIPLE} mode to MPI. MPI can be initialized with 
	this mode (in a call to \text{MPI\_THREAD\_INIT()}); if MPI supports this 
	mode, it will return \texttt{MPI\_TASK\_MULTIPLE} in the \texttt{provided} 
	argument. In this mode, a blocking MPI 
	call blocks only the executing task. As for 
	\texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE}, the proposal does not define what a "task" 
	is; unlike  \texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE}, there is no current (de facto 
	or de jure) standard for task runtimes, and different systems use different 
	runtimes. This may reduce the usefulness of this proposal, if it is not 
	augmented with a standard MPI interface to task libraries, as proposed in 
	this document.
	
	\paragraph{Callback-driven event interface for MPI\_T} (\#79) This would 
	provide an interface for the specification of callback functions to be 
	invoked when certain MPI events happen; e.g., when a receive matches a 
	send. This interface may facilitate the implementation of some of the 
	mechanisms proposed in this document -- to the least, in a prototype form.
	
	\paragraph{Endpoints} (\#56) This would enable an MPI process to 
	"own" 
	multiple ranks, each providing the usual semantics of of an MPI process. 
	This may enable splitting the MPI traffic into independent streams, thus 
	reducing thrashing.
	
	\paragraph{Additional Communicator Assertion Info Keys} (\#11,\#58) This 
	would 
	enable to specify that communication on a communicator satisfies 
	constraints that can be used to improve performance. These include (i) no 
	use of wild-cards (\texttt{no\_any\_tag, no\_any\_source}), (ii) only use 
	wild-cards (\texttt{only\_any\_tag, only\_any\_source}, (iii) matching 
	lengths for send and receive 
	buffers (\texttt{exact\_length}), (iv) out-of-order message matching 
	allowed (\texttt{allow\_overtaking}), (v)
	 restricted use of multithreading (\texttt{thread\_level()}), (vi) no 
	canceling (\texttt{no\_send\_cancel, no\_recv\_cancel}), and (vii) no use 
	of derived datatypes (\texttt{no\_derived\_datatypes}).
